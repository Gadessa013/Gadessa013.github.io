                    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
                    And sorry I could not travel both<br>
                    And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
                    And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                    To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
                    And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
                    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
                    Though as for that the passing there<br>
                    Had worn them really about the same,</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And both that morning equally lay<br>
                    In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
                    Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
                    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
                    I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
                    Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
                    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
                    I took the one less traveled by,<br>
                    And that has made all the difference.</p>

                    <p>I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
                    Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
                    Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
                    Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
                    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
                    Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
                    Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
                    The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
                    And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
                    My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br>
                    Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
                    Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
                    Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
                    The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</p>

                    <p>“Hope” is the thing with feathers -<br>
                    That perches in the soul -<br>

                    And never stops - at all -</p>

                    <p>And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -<br>
                    And sore must be the storm -<br>
                    That could abash the little Bird<br>
                    That kept so many warm -</p>

                    <p>I’ve heard it in the chillest land -<br>

                    Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,<br>
                    In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,<br>
                    Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.</p>

                    By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;<br>

                    Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br>
